# Regression Algorithms in Python

A comprehensive collection of regression algorithm implementations using Python. This repository serves as a learning resource and reference guide for various regression techniques commonly used in machine learning and data science.

## Overview

This repository contains practical examples and implementations of different regression algorithms, demonstrating their usage, strengths, and applications. Each implementation includes clear code examples and explanations to help you understand how these algorithms work.

## Algorithms Included

- **Linear Regression** - Multiple linear regression for modeling linear relationships

## Requirements

```
python
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
```


## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own Python file or Jupyter notebook. Navigate to the specific algorithm directory and run the example:

```bash
python linear_regression_example.py
```

Or open the Jupyter notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
